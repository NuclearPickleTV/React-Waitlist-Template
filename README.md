# React Waitlist Front End Template

## Introduction
Hello! I created this simple front end product waitlist website. Keep in mind this has no back end integration for the functionality of the waitlist but does have a nice and sleek design. Feel free to use this for your projects as long as you do not resell it. If you would like to contribute I welcome contributions and will gladly merge them! Enjoy!

## Prerequisites
This project uses `Tailwind`, `@Heroicons/react`, and `Vite`.

## Customization
1. Edit the `src/app.jsx` file in order to customize the text, background image, etc...
2. Edit the `index.html` file in order to add SEO and customize the tab title.

## Issues
Feel free to add an issue and I will look into it.

## Contributions
I warmly welcome any contributions and will gladly merge them if suitable.

## Usage
